# Input/Output Workflow

This document describes the data flow and user interaction flow in the BumpData application, from data input through analysis to result output.

## Data Input Flow

### 1. Dataset Upload

The data input process begins with dataset upload, which follows this sequence:

1. **File Selection:**
   - User navigates to the upload page
   - User selects a CSV/Excel/JSON file via drag-and-drop or file browser
   - System validates file format and size

2. **Initial Processing:**
   - File is uploaded to server
   - Preliminary parsing is performed
   - A preview of the data is generated
   - Basic metadata is extracted (row count, column count, file size)

3. **Schema Analysis:**
   - Column types are automatically detected (numeric, categorical, text, datetime)
   - Column profiles are generated (range, cardinality, nulls, unique values)
   - Dataset summary statistics are calculated
   - The `schemaAnalyzer.ts` utility handles this functionality

4. **Dataset Storage:**
   - Data is saved to the database with user association
   - A reference ID is generated for future access
   - The dataset appears in the user's dataset list

### 2. Target Column Selection

After upload, the user selects a target column for analysis:

1. **Column Evaluation:**
   - The system evaluates all columns to determine which can be used as targets
   - The `targetPlanner.ts` utility analyzes column properties
   - Columns are categorized by suitable analysis types (classification, regression, etc.)

2. **Selection Interface:**
   - User is presented with a list of columns suitable as targets
   - System provides recommendations based on column properties
   - Target Suggestions component displays this information

3. **Task Type Determination:**
   - Based on the selected column, the system determines applicable task types
   - Classification for categorical target columns
   - Regression for numeric target columns
   - Clustering for datasets without a specific target
   - Time series for datetime columns
   - The specific task type filters available techniques

## Analysis Configuration

With a dataset uploaded and target column selected, the user configures analysis:

1. **Technique Filtering:**
   - Available techniques are filtered based on target column type
   - The `InsightsPortfolio` component displays applicable techniques
   - Techniques are grouped by category (classification, regression, etc.)

2. **Parameter Configuration:**
   - Each technique offers configurable parameters
   - Default values are suggested based on dataset characteristics
   - Advanced options can be toggled for experienced users

3. **Auto-Running:**
   - The `autoRunner.ts` utility can automatically execute appropriate techniques
   - Pre-selection is based on dataset size and characteristics
   - Results are generated in parallel for multiple techniques

## Output Processing

After analysis execution, results are processed and presented:

1. **Result Generation:**
   - Backend executes the selected technique
   - Results are generated in standardized format
   - Multiple output types may be produced (visualization, statistics, tables, text)

2. **Result Organization:**
   - The `OutputMapContext` organizes results by output type
   - Results are stored in categorized collections
   - This enables filtering and organization in the UI

3. **Visualization Selection:**
   - The `variationEngine.ts` utility generates appropriate visualization options
   - Chart types are selected based on data characteristics
   - Multiple visualization alternatives may be offered

## User Interaction Flow

The complete input/output workflow from a user interaction perspective:

1. **Authentication:**
   - User logs in or accesses as guest
   - Guest users have temporary storage limitations

2. **Dataset Selection:**
   - User selects an existing dataset or uploads a new one
   - Dataset information and preview are displayed

3. **Analysis Configuration:**
   - User selects target column
   - System suggests applicable techniques
   - User selects technique and configures parameters

4. **Analysis Execution:**
   - User initiates analysis
   - System executes selected technique
   - Loading indicators show progress

5. **Results Exploration:**
   - Results are displayed in categorized tabs
   - User can filter by output type (charts, tables, stats, text)
   - Explanations are provided for technical results
   - User can download or share results

6. **Iterative Analysis:**
   - User can run additional techniques on the same dataset
   - Results from multiple techniques can be compared
   - Related techniques are suggested based on initial results

## State Management

The application uses a context-based state management approach:

1. **Upload Context:**
   - Manages dataset upload state
   - Tracks dataset metadata
   - Maintains loading states for different operations
   - Records recently uploaded datasets
   - Maps technique IDs to their running status and results

2. **Output Map Context:**
   - Organizes results by output type
   - Provides filtering mechanisms
   - Counts results by category
   - Manages display preferences

3. **Auth Context:**
   - Handles authentication state
   - Manages user information
   - Controls access restrictions
   - Differentiates between regular and guest users

## Error Handling

The input/output workflow includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Upload Errors:**
   - File format validation
   - Size limitations
   - Parsing errors
   - Schema detection issues

2. **Analysis Errors:**
   - Insufficient data warnings
   - Technique compatibility errors
   - Execution timeouts
   - Result generation failures

3. **Display Errors:**
   - Data visualization fallbacks
   - Empty result handling
   - Rendering alternatives
