## Project Overview

BumpData is a full-stack web application designed to provide advanced data analysis capabilities with a user-friendly interface. The application allows users to:

- Upload datasets in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Analyze data using multiple machine learning techniques
- Visualize results through interactive charts and tables
- Save and export analyses
- Manage datasets and results

The system is built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and Python, utilizing PostgreSQL for data storage and offering a comprehensive set of analysis tools powered by scikit-learn and other libraries.
